Spray the inside of the pans with canola oil. Place parchment circles in the pan bottoms and spray over top with canola oil. Set aside.\nPrepare & Bake Cakes: in a large mixing bowl, combine eggs, melted butter, and milk. Add cake mix. Whisk together until batter is smooth; fold in orange zest. Divide batter evenly among the 3 cake pans. Place on center oven rack and bake; at 40 minutes, test cake centers with a toothpick; when toothpicks come out clean, remove cakes and let cool (in pans) for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, run a knife around the inside of each cake pan, flip pans upside down and ease cakes out onto a cooling rack to cool completely, about 40-50 minutes.\nPrepare Frosting: while cakes are cooling, make buttercream frosting. Add butter to a stand mixer (a hand mixer will work too) fitted with a paddle; beat at medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar, cream, and vanilla; mix at low speed until just combined. Increase the speed to high and mix until smooth and fluffy, about 3 to 5 minutes. If it becomes too thick, add a little more cream. If it's too thin, add more powdered sugar.\nMeasure about 1 cup of plain buttercream frosting, set aside. Fold in diced strawberries into remaining frosting.\nAssemble Cake: place dollop of frosting in center of cake stand or platter to anchor. Place first cake, top side down, over the frosting and center on the plate. Carefully apply strawberry buttercream along the edges, leaving bare a medium-sized circle in the center of the cake. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of strawberry preserves into the frosting-less center; top preserves with fresh sliced strawberries. Place the next layer on top of the first and repeat strawberry buttercream, preserves and sliced strawberries steps.\nPlace the last cake layer on top and frost with strawberry buttercream; as lightly as you'd like, frost sides of the entire cake with plain buttercream. Decorate the top of the cake with whole strawberries and slices of orange.Preheat oven to 350°F.Prepare three 8-inch square cake pans: use bottom of a cake pan to measure/trace 3 circles on parchment paper; cut out the circles and set aside.

Spray with canola oil, then sauté bell peppers and onions until they just begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add baby spinach and sprinkle with a few dashes of 21 seasoning salute. Keep stirring until spinach begins to wilt, another 2 minutes. Add crumbled soy chorizo and stir another minute until well incorporated. Remove about ⅓ of the ingredients from the skillet and set aside on a plate (for garnishing the top of the frittata).\nMake sure all the ingredients are in an even layer on the bottom of the skillet, then pour the egg mixture over the top. Cook the frittata over medium heat, without stirring, until about 1 inch from the edge has begun to set, about 4-5 minutes. Sprinkle the sautéed ingredients that had been set aside over the top of the frittata and turn off heat.\nTransfer the skillet to the oven and bake for about 16-18 minutes. Do not overcook. The consistency should be more like a custard than a sponge, so keep a close eye on it toward the end. The center might still look a little jiggly even when it is ready—so to check doneness—cut a small slit in the center of the frittata. If you see runny eggs in the cut, bake for another few minutes; if the eggs are set, it's done!\nFor a crispy top, heat broiler then sprinkle reserved ¼ cup of cheese over the top of the frittata then broil until cheese is browned and bubbling, about 1 minute. To serve, run a rubber spatula around edge of frittata and transfer to a plate. Cut into wedges, garnish with tomatoes and cilantro and enjoy!Preheat oven to 375°F. In a large bowl, whisk together 12 eggs, ⅓ cup half & half and about 5 dashes of 21 seasoning salute. Whisk until eggs are nice and fluffy. Stir in ¾ cup of shredded cheese then set aside.Heat a deep, 10-inch ovenproof skillet (a well-seasoned cast iron skillet works best), over medium heat. Spray with canola oil, then sauté bell peppers and onions until they just begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add baby spinach and sprinkle with a few dashes of 21 seasoning salute. Keep stirring until spinach begins to wilt, another 2 minutes. Add crumbled soy chorizo and stir another minute until well incorporated. Remove about ⅓ of the ingredients from the skillet and set aside on a plate (for garnishing the top of the frittata).Make sure all the ingredients are in an even layer on the bottom of the skillet, then pour the egg mixture over the top. Cook the frittata over medium heat, without stirring, until about 1 inch from the edge has begun to set, about 4-5 minutes. Sprinkle the sautéed ingredients that had been set aside over the top of the frittata and turn off heat.Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for about 16-18 minutes. Do not overcook. The consistency should be more like a custard than a sponge, so keep a close eye on it toward the end. The center might still look a little jiggly even when it is ready—so to check doneness—cut a small slit in the center of the frittata.

Scoop cheese mixture into center of wrap, then gather wrap up on all sides, gently shaping the mixture into a ball. Twist the ends of the cling wrap tightly, and refrigerate cheese ball (2 hours minimum, but overnight really lets the flavors meld together!).Before serving, remove cheese ball from fridge. Spread chopped pecans on work surface. Unwrap cheese ball and press into chopped pecans, gently reshaping as needed. Serve with a cheese spreader, surrounded by TJ's Golden Rounds Crackers.",

Place pie dish into freezer until fudge and ice cream layers harden, about 1 hour. If layers have not hardened before adding the whipped cream they will overflow, so use caution (the springform pan is a little more forgiving).\nTo make the cold brew whipped cream: Meanwhile, with a stand mixer or hand mixer, in a large bowl, whip 2 cups heavy cream, 1 cup cold brew and 2 tsp sugar until firm peaks form. Cover and refrigerate. Once ice cream and fudge layers harden, remove dish from freezer, then add whipped cream.

Spray the inside of the pans with canola oil. Place parchment circles on the bottom of each pan and spray over top with butter flavored oil. Set aside.\nPrepare & Bake Cakes: in three separate bowls, prepare each cake mix. For vanilla cake, mix together 2 eggs, 1 stick of melted butter, and 1 cup milk; add dry mix and whisk until batter is smooth; pour into cake pan. For brownies, whisk together 2 eggs with 1 stick of melted butter; add dry mix and stir until moistened; pour into cake pan. For blondies, whisk together 1 egg with 1 stick of melted butter; add dry mix and stir until moistened; pour into cake pan.

After 10 minutes, run a knife around the inside of each cake pan, flip pans upside down and ease cakes out onto a cooling rack to cool completely, about 40-50 minutes.\nPrepare Frosting: while cakes are cooling, make buttercream frosting.

If it's too thin, add more powdered sugar.\nAssemble Cake: place a dollop of buttercream on cake stand or platter to anchor, place brownie layer on top. Pipe or spread buttercream frosting along the edges of the cake; fill in center with ¼ jar of caramel sauce. Top with blondie cake and repeat buttercream and caramel step. Top with vanilla cake layer; as lightly as you like frost sides of the entire cake with remaining buttercream.\nDecorate Cake: warm the jar of fudge sauce for 10 seconds in the microwave and pour ½ over the top of the cake and allow to flow down the sides in long drips.

Makes about 20 toasts.To make the chimichurri sauce: Combine 2 tablespoons vinegar, 8 grinds South African seasoning, 2 teaspoons oregano, 6 garlic cloves and 4 tablespoons of EVOO in a blender or food processor. Pulse until garlic minces to desired consistency. Add cilantro and parsley and pulse a few more times until desired consistency. Pour mixture into a bowl and stir in reserved 6 tablespoons of EVOO. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired. Makes about 1 cup of sauce. Set aside.To prepare toasts: Brush olive oil on one side of each bread slice then grill face down until golden grill marks appear. Alternatively you can place them on a baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes until they are crisp and browned. Place mozzarella slices on top each toast then spoon chimichurri sauce over the cheese. Serve. Makes about 20 toasts.",
